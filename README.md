This repository contains everything necessary to build a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box based on [Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/) with a preinstalled [mxe](http://mxe.cc/) cross-building environment.

Instead of building a base box from scratch an [existing box](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/debian/boxes/jessie64) is modified and repackaged as described by [Nicholas Cerminara](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-create-a-vagrant-base-box-from-an-existing-one).
